Here is the folder with all of my data. 

1. fig_4_data_on_relevant_genes_in_29_tissues is from the original paper, accessed February 2022, and has the top 20 relevant genes in 29 tissues in the body. There are 323 total genes, but 624 data points as there is overlap between the tissues.

2. similarity_between_29_tissues_data_for_fig_4 contains the results from my process of using data set 1 and finding the Jaccard similarity between the tissues.


All other datasets in my results notebooks are versions of these, whether I cleaned the dataset or removed/added columns (percent rank, mean percent rank).
